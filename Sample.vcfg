// VortexConfig v0.1, Copyright (C) Micha≈Ç Pazurek

/*
 *	This is a sample configuration file made to test the VortexConfig parser.
 *	The parser should support line and block comments, standard key=value pairs,
 *	keys and values in quotes, objects (defined with curly brackets {} with nested key=value pairs,
 *	separated with a comma ,), arrays (defined with square brackets [] with values only, also separated
 *	with a comma ,)
 *
 *	The parser is in development phase so it may crash or return false values in some edge cases!
